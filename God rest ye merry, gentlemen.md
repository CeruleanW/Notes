Maddy Prior sings God Rest You Merry Gentlemen

God rest you merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay,
Remember Christ our Saviour
Was born upon this day,
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray;

Chorus (after each verse)
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy!

In Bethlehem in Jewry
this placid babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The Virgin mother Mary
Did nothing taking scorn,

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed angel came.
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same,
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name:

“Fear not,” then said the angel,
“Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour,
Of virtue, power, and might;
So frequently to vanish all
The friends of Satan quite”;

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding,
In tempest, storm and wind,
And went to Bethlehem straightway
This blessed babe to find:

But when to Bethlehem they came,
Whereat this infant lay
They found him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His mother Mary kneeling,
Unto the Lord did pray:

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
Is drawing on apace:
