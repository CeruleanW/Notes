# Joyful, joyful we adore thee
CHORUS
Joyful, joyful we adore thee
God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before thee
Opening to the sun above

Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light of day

All thy works with joy surround thee
Earth and heaven reflect thy rays
Stars and angels sing around thee
Center of unbroken praise

Field and and forest, vale and mountain
Flowery meadow, flashing sea
Chanting bird and flowing fountain
Call us to rejoice in thee

Joyful music leads us sunward
In the triumph song
Joyful music leads us sunward
In the triumph song of life
