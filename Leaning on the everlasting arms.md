* What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
* Leaning on the everlasting arms;
* What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,
* Leaning on the everlasting arms.
* *Refrain*:
* Leaning, leaning, safe and secure from all alarms;
* Leaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms.
* O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,
* Leaning on the everlasting arms;
* O how bright the path grows from day to day,
* Leaning on the everlasting arms.
* *Refrain*
* What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
* Leaning on the everlasting arms;
* I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,
* Leaning on the everlasting arms.
* *Refrain*
